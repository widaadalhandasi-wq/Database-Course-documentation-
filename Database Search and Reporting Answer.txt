ANSWER QUESTION 1:

Flat File Systems and Relational Databases across structure, redundancy, relationships, example usage, and drawbacks.

Structure

Flat File Systems

Single-file storage where records are stored sequentially (e.g., CSV, TXT).

No schema enforcement beyond the file structure itself.

Data stored as plain text or simple binary formats; usually delimited fields.

Relational Databases (RDBMS)

Data organized into tables (relations) with rows and columns.

Each table has a defined schema (data types, constraints, keys).

Support for indexes, views, transactions, and query engines (SQL).

Data Redundancy

Flat File Systems

High risk of redundancy — same data often duplicated across multiple files.

No built-in mechanisms for normalization or constraints.

Relational Databases

Designed to minimize redundancy via normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF, etc.).

Referential integrity enforces consistent references between tables.

Relationships

Flat File Systems

Relationships (if any) must be managed manually by the application logic (e.g., matching IDs across files).

No constraints or joins at the storage layer.

Relational Databases

Native support for relationships (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many) via foreign keys and join operations.

Declarative queries (SQL) allow combining related data easily.

Example Usage

Flat File Systems

Small, simple data exchange (logs, CSV exports/imports, one-off datasets).

Lightweight tools, prototypes, configuration files.

Relational Databases

Business applications, financial systems, inventory, student records, e-commerce, and any system requiring concurrency and integrity.

Drawbacks

Flat File Systems

Poor scalability for complex data; fragile integrity; inefficient queries over large datasets; no support for concurrency or transactions.

Relational Databases

More complex to set up and maintain; can be heavier resource-wise; rigid schema can be limiting for highly variable/unstructured data (but modern RDBMS and extensions mitigate this).
