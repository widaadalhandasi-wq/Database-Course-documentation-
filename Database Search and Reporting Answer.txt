ANSWER QUESTION 1:

Flat File Systems and Relational Databases across structure, redundancy, relationships, example usage, and drawbacks.

Structure

Flat File Systems

Single-file storage where records are stored sequentially (e.g., CSV, TXT).

No schema enforcement beyond the file structure itself.

Data stored as plain text or simple binary formats; usually delimited fields.

Relational Databases (RDBMS)

Data organized into tables (relations) with rows and columns.

Each table has a defined schema (data types, constraints, keys).

Support for indexes, views, transactions, and query engines (SQL).

Data Redundancy

Flat File Systems

High risk of redundancy — same data often duplicated across multiple files.

No built-in mechanisms for normalization or constraints.

Relational Databases

Designed to minimize redundancy via normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF, etc.).

Referential integrity enforces consistent references between tables.

Relationships

Flat File Systems

Relationships (if any) must be managed manually by the application logic (e.g., matching IDs across files).

No constraints or joins at the storage layer.

Relational Databases

Native support for relationships (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many) via foreign keys and join operations.

Declarative queries (SQL) allow combining related data easily.

Example Usage

Flat File Systems

Small, simple data exchange (logs, CSV exports/imports, one-off datasets).

Lightweight tools, prototypes, configuration files.

Relational Databases

Business applications, financial systems, inventory, student records, e-commerce, and any system requiring concurrency and integrity.

Drawbacks

Flat File Systems

Poor scalability for complex data; fragile integrity; inefficient queries over large datasets; no support for concurrency or transactions.

Relational Databases

More complex to set up and maintain; can be heavier resource-wise; rigid schema can be limiting for highly variable/unstructured data (but modern RDBMS and extensions mitigate this).

ANSWER QUESTION 3:

Roles in a Database System

System Analyst

Gathers requirements from stakeholders, models business processes, and translates business needs into technical specifications.

Works closely with database designers and application developers to ensure the system meets functional needs.

Database Designer

Designs logical and physical schemas, chooses normalization level, defines tables, keys, indexes, and relationships.

Ensures the model supports performance, integrity, and storage considerations.

Database Developer

Implements database objects: tables, views, stored procedures, functions, triggers, and batch jobs.

Writes and optimizes SQL queries, and collaborates with application developers to integrate the database.

DBA (Database Administrator)

Manages installation, configuration, backups, monitoring, security, and tuning of the DBMS.

Responsible for availability, recovery planning, and applying updates/patches.

Application Developer

Builds the application layer that interacts with the database through APIs/ORMs/SQL queries.

Ensures correct usage of transactions and proper handling of errors and edge cases.

BI Developer (Business Intelligence Developer)

Designs ETL/ELT processes, data warehouses/data marts, cubes, reports, and dashboards.

Translates business questions into data models and reporting artifacts for analytics.
